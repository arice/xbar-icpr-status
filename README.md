# DEPRECATED
fresh code is in my fork of the xbar-plugins repo: https://github.com/arice/xbar-plugins

## xbar-icpr-status
xbar plugin to display the status of iCloud Private Relay

This plugin checks if the IP used for an insecure http request can be found on Apple's list of egress IPs used by iCloud Private Relay and shows a happy green sparkle if so, or a scary red flag if not. This plugin is based on My External IP by CodinCafe.

It's designed to be used with [xbar](https://xbarapp.com), an open source extensible menu bar utility for macOS.
